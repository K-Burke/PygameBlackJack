Future plans:

1. More checks for inputs on login and signup pages.
    DONE - Checking passwords for strength
    - Checking emails for validity
    DONE - Checking for integers for wallet
    - Checking for sql injection/other security concerns in all inputs
    
2. Create pop-ups for when the checks in the above input fields are not met.
    - Incorrect passwords, invalid/used emails, etc
    - Maybe a pop-up for when you run out of money
        - This could allow you to navigate to the add funds page. (See item 3)

3. Create add funds page, could be a green plus button up near the wallet display.
    DONE - could just be a fake thing were you have fake credit card info and then you just type
        in a number and it's added to your wallet
    DONE - just need to make the submit button actually do something now
    
4. Double Down Button.
    - Add the double down button beside hit button
    - If clicked and bet_placed (and whatever else)
        - Double the wager, hit once, and then playerDone = True

5. Split button.
    - If both first cards are doubles, split button is there
    - If clicked, splits them both into seperate hands (can't do this yet, see item 6)

6. Multiple hands. (biggest thing rn is how to display this nicely)
    - allow up to 3 hands, and each one can split once (player.hands[6])
    - need to go back basically everywhere that calls player1.hands[0]
        - it will need to be player1.hands[i], and each of the functions need to take i
            - then might have to make player turn as a function, and call it on each hand.

FOR ITEMS 5 AND 6: 
    - when a hand is split, put the new hand at i + 3 (so if on i=0, store at i=3)
        for i in range(3):
            turn(i)
            if player.hands[i+3] isn't null:
                turn(i+3)

7. Insurance. 
    - implementing insurance
        - if dealer shows ace, can pay so if it is blackjack you don't lose.

8. BUG
    - When you place a bet and see your cards, you can just close the app 
     and you wont lose the wager. No penalty
        - Fix this maybe by adding a pop up that says, are you sure you want to 
         ditch your wager, it will be lost. 
            - Only if a wager is currently placed
            - There would be a yes, and a canel, if yes, take the wager away and update
    !!! For now, i just made it so you lose the money. Pop-up would be good though
